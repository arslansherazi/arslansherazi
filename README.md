### Hi I am Arslan Haider Sherazi ðŸ‘‹

An experienced software engineer and full-stack developer from Pakistan. I've got a great passion for development and programming using modern tools and technologies.

My passion for innovation has enabled me to learn a wide range of programming languages and techniques during my four years of development experience. I'm always searching for the latest updates in the programming industry to get familiar with the state-of-the-art tools being used for full-stack development.

My strong analytical skills allow me to deal thoroughly with even the most sophisticated system requirements and implement efficient solutions to fulfill these requirements. I've got experience working in different areas of development such as data science, designing attractive and user-friendly interfaces, creating APIs from scratch, and deployment of software to cloud-based platforms such as AWS servers. My biggest strength is that I'm always open to learning more about the latest development technologies and continually improving my skills to build world-class projects.

Currently, I work with various full stack development tools and technologies such as:

â€¢ Python, ReactJS, React Native, and Golang.

â€¢ Cloud-based platforms like AWS and Azure. 

â€¢ Building efficient backend services and APIs using Flask, Django, FastAPI and 
  Gorilla Mux Frameworks. 

â€¢ Deployment of APIs on cloud services like AWS and Azure. 

â€¢ Building user-friendly frontends with ReactJS for web apps and React Native 
  for mobile apps.

Machine learning, data science, full stack development, AI, and data scrapping are some of the many fields that interest me, and I plan to keep learning new skills and improving them in these fields. <br><br>
